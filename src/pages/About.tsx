          <p>
            Hi, I'm the founder and chief editor of Trending News. With years of experience in software development and technical writing, I discovered a passion for breaking down complex tech topics. What started as personal notes quickly grew into a platform aimed at helping others overcome the typical roadblocks in tech education. When I'm not writing, I'm usually testing out the newest AI tools or experimenting with automation pipelines.
